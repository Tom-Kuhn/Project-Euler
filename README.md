Project-Euler
=============

Personal repository for project Euler solutions (https://projecteuler.net/). I decided to start working on this problem set in order to help me learn and practice F# whilst brushing up on my algorithm/maths skills.

##WARNING##
The source code within this repository is unlikely to be nice clean ideomatic F# (as I'm using this as an excue to learn and practice it). The code quality may improve through the problems, but I don't intend to go back over the problems and clean up the code!
